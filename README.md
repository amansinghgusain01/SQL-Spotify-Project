# SQL-Spotify-Project
🎧 Spotify Data Analysis Using SQL
This project explores a comprehensive Spotify dataset using structured SQL queries to extract insights about music tracks, artists, listener preferences, and streaming patterns. With 50 analytical questions ranging from basic to advanced difficulty, the project showcases how SQL can be leveraged for real-world data analytics.

📌 Project Objective
To analyze Spotify streaming data using SQL and uncover insights related to song popularity, artist trends, energy levels, user engagement, and content classification. The analysis supports decision-making in marketing, playlist design, and user experience.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Language: SQL

Database: MySQL

Environment: Localhost / Cloud SQL

Optional: Power BI / Excel for extended visualization

📊 Dataset Features
The dataset contains rich musical metadata and performance metrics with columns like:

artist, track, album, album_type

danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo

duration_min, views, likes, comments, stream, channel, official_video, licensed, most_played_on, energy_liveness

🔍 Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated
Basic Queries

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX)

Filtering (WHERE, HAVING)

Sorting (ORDER BY)

Subqueries & Nested Queries

Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK())

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Conditional Logic using CASE

📈 Sample Insights
Top-streamed tracks and artists

Songs with the highest likes and views

Classification of songs by energy levels

Filtering tracks based on speechiness, acousticness, and instrumentalness
